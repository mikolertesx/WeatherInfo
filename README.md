# Weather Project
I'm using [MetaWeather](https://www.metaweather.com/api) api for this project, because it provides *https* and doesn't require an auth key.

## Issues faced
CORS-Requests failed everytime, luckily I found a great extension for Chrome (Access-Control-Alow-Origin), it adds the header to the request, so that I can use it without a server (Development environment).

## Technologies
By trying to use best practices, I've added React-Redux to manage the place and date of the app everywhere.
